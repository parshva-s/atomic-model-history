      <h2>Scientist: John Dalton</h2>
      <p><b>The discovery:</b> An Atom, the smallest form of matter</p>
      <p><b>Date of Discovery:</b> 1810</p>
      <p><b>Model:</b> Billiard Ball Model</p>
      <img src="Model Images/Dalton's Model.png" />
      <p>
        <b>Importance of Discovery:</b> Dalton's discovery was important as it
        explained different atoms having different properties and atoms being
        able to react with each other in whole number ratios.

      <h2>Scientist: J.J. Thomson</h2>
      <p><b>The discovery:</b> Sub-atomic Particles - The Electron</p>
      <p><b>Date of Discovery:</b> 1887</p>
      <p><b>Model:</b> Raisin Pudding Model</p>
      <img src="Model Images/Thomson's Model.png" />
      <p>
        <b>Importance of Discovery:</b> Thomson's discovery is important as it
        provided evidence that there are subatomic particles in an atom,
        therefore the atom isn't the smallest form of matter. It also accounts
        for an atom having subatomic particles with charges (electron having a
        negative charge).

      <h2>Scientist: Max Planck</h2>
      <p>
        <b>The discovery:</b> The Transfer of Energy in Discrete Amounts
        (Quantum)
      </p>
      <p><b>Date of Discovery:</b> 1900</p>
      <p>
        <b>Importance of Discovery:</b> Planck's discovery of minimum energy
        needed for objects to absorb/emit energy and energy being transfered in
        quanta is the basis of quantum mechanics. He also was able to discover
        Planck's constant which used in many calculations for atomic physics.

      <h2>Scientist: Albert Einstein</h2>
      <p>
        <b>The discovery:</b> Photoelectric Effect and Mass-Energy Equivalence
      </p>
      <p><b>Date of Discovery:</b> 1905</p>
      <p>
        <b>Importance of Discovery:</b> The photoelectric effect is a very
        significant discovery because it provides a relationship between photons
        (light particles) and electron (subatomic particles) which is more proof
        of wave-particle duality. His mass-energy equivalence theory is also
        very important, especially in nuclear phyics as it helps scientists
        determine the total amount of energy that can be created if mass is lost
        or that energy can even be turned into matter.

      <h2>Scientist: Robert Millikan</h2>
      <p><b>The discovery:</b> The Charge of an Electron</p>
      <p><b>Date of Discovery:</b> 1906-1913</p>
      <p>
        <b>Importance of Discovery:</b> Millikan's famous oil drop experiment
        proved the charge of an electron to be 1.6 x 10<sup>-19</sup> coulumbs.
        This number is very important when talking about electricity and the
        flow of electrons in terms of electric forces and electrical energy and
        so the value of a charge of an electron that he deduced has application
        to many other part of physics.

      <h2>Scientist: Ernest Rutherford</h2>
      <p><b>The discovery:</b> The Nucleus</p>
      <p><b>Date of Discovery:</b> 1914</p>
      <p><b>Model:</b> Planetary Model</p>
      <img src="Model Images/Rutherford's Model.png" />
      <p>
        <b>Importance of Discovery:</b> The importance of Rutherford's discovery
        is that it is an advancement in the structure of the atom with the
        nucleus being concentrated with nucleons in the center and electrons
        residing in the free spaces around the nucleus.

      <h2>Scientist: Niels Bohr</h2>
      <p><b>The discovery:</b> Quantized Energy Levels</p>
      <p><b>Date of Discovery:</b> 1915</p>
      <p><b>Model:</b> Bohr's Energy Level Model</p>
      <img src="Model Images/Bohr's Model.png" />
      <p>
        <b>Importance of Discovery:</b> Bohr was able to determine different
        quantized levels in which the electrons can move between and stay in
        such that electrons cannot be in between energy levels. Electrons can
        either absorb photons to move up an energy level (dark line spectra) or
        emit photons to move down an energy level (bright line spectra).

      <h2>Scientist: Louis De Broglie</h2>
      <p><b>The discovery:</b> Electrons Behaving as Waves</p>
      <p><b>Date of Discovery:</b> 1923</p>
      <p><b>Model:</b> Wave Mechanical Model</p>
      <img src="Model Images/Broglie's Model.png" />
      <p>
        <b>Importance of Discovery:</b> He was able to better structure atom by
        introducing electrons behaving as wave which proved Bohr's quantized
        orbit's since they can exist where they interfer constructively. The
        most important apsect of his aspect is that he was able to solve the
        question that models prior to his models couldn't account for: because
        electrons behave as standing waves orbiting the nucleus, they
        <b>DO NOT</b> emit EMR.

      <h2>Scientist: Ernest Schrodinger</h2>
      <p><b>The discovery:</b> Probability of Finding an Electron</p>
      <p><b>Date of Discovery:</b> 1926</p>
      <p><b>Model:</b> Schrodinger's Quantum Mechanical Model</p>
      <img src="Model Images/Schrodinger's Model.png" />
      <p>
        <b>Importance of Discovery:</b> The discovery is important as it gives
        us a better idea of where the electrons <b>MAY</b> be located. There are
        areas of higher probability (more dense regions) and lower probability
        (less dense regions) which help explain the quantum aspect of atoms as
        these ares of high and low probability are a certain distance (radius)
        away from the nucleus.
